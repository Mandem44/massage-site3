<p>"I have been suffering from severe pain in my shoulders and neck area on and off for quite some period of time. Many therapists have only focused on this area of the body and despite many treatments and massages, this pain kept recurring. It was hell. Tillman has a holistic approach and found that I had discomfort in both the hip and gastrointestinal areas that were directly related to the shoulder pain. The connection between trigger point massage on the shoulders and loosening in the gastrointestinal and hip areas helped me immediately and for the long term. I still have problems from time to time, but thanks to the advice I can directly counteract with exercise and diet and it is nowhere near as bad as before. If it gets worse again, I always go back to Till, who observes my symptoms in the longer term. He then adjusts the therapy. I have also noticed that he is wonderful at remembering the details. For this reason, I can recommend Tillmann with a very clear conscience." - K.A.B. </p>

<p>“I approached Tillman after he was recommended to me via a few friends who were receiving regular treatments with him. I had been suffering from a chronic shoulder injury; something which I’d consulted numerous doctors, manual therapists, physiotherapists and chiropractors about, all of which struggled to help me with my situation. From the initial consultation and now to the ongoing treatment I’ve received, Tillman has approached my case with nothing but the highest level of professionalism. His holistic approach to how my body has reacted to my injury has meant that in only a number of sessions I’ve already regained almost all of the movement which I’d previously lost. I’d highly recommend Tillman to anyone who is looking for a massage therapist, whether it’s for a general rebalancing of your back or for treatment of an injury, Tillman would be able to help you.” - Marino.

<p>"Tillman is an excellent, experienced and very intuitive massage therapist, in my opinion. I have been regularly going to him due to back pain for about 6 months now and my pain has reduced considerably - in short, his massage has helped me most in regaining an almost painfree everyday. Tillman is very engaged in his massage practise: from the carefully chosen music, which helps a lot with relaxing  to the attention towards his clients, which extends also beyond the sessions themselves, for eg. when he asks for updates or gives advice on exercises to be done at home. Not only has he helped me with my pain but he has also been the first to actually explain to me the details of my problem, which I find invaluable. I can only fully recommend Tillman as a massage therapist and find myself lucky to have found him." - Petra. C </P>

<p>"I've been getting massages with Tillman for over a year and they are an essential part of my routine. Every session is different and I am constantly impressed by Tillman's boundless knowledge, skill, enthusiasm and attention to my individual needs — whether it be for relaxation or recovery. He is the first massage therapist I've returned to on a regular basis, and once you give him a shot, you'll never want to give your time or money to anyone else. I've been to a lot of massage therapists, but Tillman is easily the best." - Will. B </p>
