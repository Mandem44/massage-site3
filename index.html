 	<p> Welcome to this simple little info spot! <br />
	<p> Many people ask what "style" of massage I do. Simply put, my style of massage is located at the intersection between medicinal and meditative. </p>
	<p>For me, it's just as important that the mind relaxes through the treatment. Only then can the muscles fully relax. More often than not, it's this balanced consideration of mind and body that keeps clients coming back. An essential point of focus for my treatments is the music selection. I have a second life in ambient music creation and draw on this knowledge to curate ambient mixes which are effective in helping maintain your meditative state.</p>
	<p> On the not so abstract side, I hold a diploma qualification in remedial massage therapy from The Carleton University in Ottawa, and have over eight years of professional experience both in clinics and working for professional sporting teams. </p>
	<p> I focus mainly on "classical" massage techniques, namely trigger point therapy, deep tissue massage and myofascial release. It's common that I also incorporate passive stretching techniques as well as prescribe take home exercises when deemed necessary. </p>
	<p>Further than that, I just really like doing what I do. So drop me a line if you feel like it suits. Dont forget we mobile also so just let us know your location.</p>
